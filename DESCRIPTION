Description: This is the first assignment for BIS557. The package (at least in theory) includes a function for taking a data set (as a frame), along with a formula and a list of constants to be used for factor variables, and performs a linear model regression onto the first column. The package includes a data.frame called "lm_patho.csv" for use in testing and examples. Finally, it includes a testing file ("test-linear-model.r") for testing.

lm_patho.csv and test-linear-model.r were produced by the professor and downloaded from https://github.com/BIS557/homework-1-cck42.git. The package was written by me, based on a template package produced in class and available at https://github.com/BIS557/bis557-2019/tree/master/9-9. Any copied and pasted code will have an associated note in the code detailing how much I wrote.
