Description: This package is completing the requirements of assignment 1 for BIS557. The package contains 2 functions. linear_model() is a function which mimics the lm() built-in function. It returns coefficients for a linear model given data and a formula. The linear_model2() function does the same thing using gradient descent rather than direct solving.
